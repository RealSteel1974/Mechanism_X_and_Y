## Architecture
![Mechanism_X_Y](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1f76c44-5b5e-4d8d-9903-6aa38845ffd4)


## Problem Statement
There are N banks(merchants) and M customers. A customer can have an account in multiple banks. 

/transactions.csv - represents various transaction data

/CustomerImportance.csv - A higher weightage for a customer and transaction type means banks want to give higher benefits to those customers for those transaction types. Ignore the fraud field.

Create a mechanism X to invoke every second and create a chunk of next 10,000 transaction entries from GDrive and put them into a S3 folder.

Create a mechanism Y that starts at the same time as X and ingests the above S3 stream as soon as transaction chunk files become available, detects the below patterns asap and puts these detections to S3 , 50 at a time to a unique file. Each detection consists of YStartTime(IST), detectionTime(IST),patternId, ActionType, customerName, MerchantId. 

Whichever fields for a given detection aren't applicable, leave them as “” empty string.

Use postgres to store any temp information.

Patterns

PatId1 - A customer in the top 10 percentile for a given merchant for the total number of transactions with the bottom 10% percentile weight averaged over all transaction types, merchant wants to UPGRADE(actionType) them. Upgradation only begins once total transactions for the merchant exceed 50K.

PatId2 - A customer whose average transaction value for a given merchant < Rs 23 and made at least 80 transactions with that merchant, merchant wants to mark them as CHILD(actionType) asap.

PatId3 - Merchants where number of Female customers < number of Male customers overall and number of female customers > 100, are marked DEI-NEEDED(actionType)
